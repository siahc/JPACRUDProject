# JPACRUDProject

####This was a very challenging but fun project and I feel like everything we've learned is coming together. 
In this project, the user is given a list of succulents in the database. The user may click on any individual succulent and be given information about the plant. The user may edit all information about the succulent but the ID number. 
The user may delete any of the succulents listed and will receive a message saying if delete was successful or not. 
The user may also add a comepletely new plant to the DB and will be able to see the new plant added to the home page. 

This project has really taught me to get used to carefully reading the errors in the console and using this to debug my program. I found that peviously I would just glaze over the errors, but through this project I found out who helpful it is to read carefully and learn where to look for the error notifications.
